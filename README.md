# CompareDigits
Compare digits using fourier transform





## Installation

### Environment 

I use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because it comes with many Python
packages already installed and it is easy to work with. After installing Anaconda,
you should create a [conda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)
so you do not destroy your main installation in case you make a mistake somewhere:

       conda create --name machine_translation python=3.7

Now you can switch to the new environment by running the following:

      source activate machine_translation
      
### Required Packages

The Python packages that this project requires are listed in requirements.txt

To install the required Python packages and dependencies you first have to activate the conda-environment as described above, and then you run the following command in a terminal:

      pip install -r requirements.txt
